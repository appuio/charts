## Upgrading from Charts 0.x to 1.x

* In `image.repository` the registry domain was moved into its own parameter `image.registry`.
* K8up 1.x features leader election, this enables rolling updates and multiple replicas.
  `k8up.enableLeaderElection` defaults to `true`. Disable this for older Kubernetes versions (<= 1.15)
* `replicaCount` is now configurable, defaults to `1`.
* Note: Deployment strategy type has changed from `Recreate` to `RollingUpdate`.
* CRDs need to be installed separately, they are no longer included in this chart.
